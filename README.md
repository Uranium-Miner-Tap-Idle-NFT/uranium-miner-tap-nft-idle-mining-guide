## ⚙️ What is Uranium Miner Tap?

Uranium Miner Tap is a Web3 idle mining game where players tap to mine uranium, upgrade reactors, and earn $URMT tokens using NFT-based mining rigs. The deeper you dig, the more powerful your upgrades become, with automation systems, reactor chains, and fuel boosters unlocking massive rewards.

With strategic tapping, reactor placement, and NFT enhancement, the game blends crypto economy with idle clicker mechanics.
